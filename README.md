# ATM-Data-managment
Welcome to the ATM Data Management Application repository! This C++ application uses object-oriented programming concepts to manage ATM data and transactions.

The application allows users to create an account, deposit and withdraw money, view account balance, and view transaction history. The data is stored in a file and can be accessed by the user at any time.

The repository is organized into several directories, including:

src: This directory contains the source code for the application, including the header files and implementation files for each class.
data: This directory contains the data file used to store account information and transaction history.
To get started with the application, you can clone this repository onto your local machine and compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Once the application is compiled, you can run it and follow the prompts to create an account, deposit and withdraw money, and view transaction history.

The application uses several object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The classes used in the application include Account, Transaction, Deposit, and Withdrawal. Each class has its own header file and implementation file.

If you would like to make any changes to the application, you can modify the source code as needed. You can also add additional classes or modify the existing ones to suit your needs.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions about the application code, feel free to create a new issue in the repository.

Thank you for using the ATM Data Management Application repository, and I hope you find it helpful!
